I am a bachelor's student in Simulation Technology at the University of Stuttgart. As part of my studies, I have taken various modules in mathematics, including Calculus 1, 2, and 3, functional calculus, and numerical mathematics. In physics, I have completed courses in experimental physics and an introduction to quantum physics, among others. For my electives, I have focused on AI and bioinformatics courses.

Currently, I am working as a research student at the Institute of Biochemistry and Technical Biochemistry, under the supervision of [Prof. JÃ¼rgen Pleiss](https://www.ibtb.uni-stuttgart.de/institut/team/Pleiss-00001/). My work involves the [Python Enzyme Engineering Database](https://github.com/PyEED/pyeed?tab=readme-ov-file) (PyEED), a Python package we are developing for protein analysis. PyEED is built on Neo4J and facilitates the creation of networks for proteins, DNA, and ontologies. Currently, I am using PyEED to investigate TEM-Lactamase proteins.

In my future [research](../research/), I hope to continue studying TEM proteins and further explore the use of graph databases and vector embeddings for ontologies in bioinformatics.

Outside my academic work, I am an indoor climbing instructor at a local climbing gym and enjoy training for upcoming triathlon events, which I am very passionate about. In my remaining free time, I read extensively and try to consume as much non-fiction as possible.
